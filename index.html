                Water is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and Grass, which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players. Water is the most common type with over 100 Pokémon,
                which are based on a wide variety of fish and other sea-dwelling creatures.</div>

                Fire is one of the three basic elemental types along with Water and Grass, which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players. Fire types are notoriously rare in the early stages
                of the games so choosing the Fire variation starter is often a plus.</div>

                5 defensive weaknesses and 7 types that are resistant to Grass moves.</div>

                The AR game's potential for weight loss was a big part of that discussion. In the process of getting out their doors and visiting parks, players found they were losing weight almost in spite of themselves. A Reddit Pokémon Go fan won acclaim for reporting
                that he'd lost 65 pounds between July and December.

        <h2 class="pmh2">Q and A</h2>
        <div class="qa-content">Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer</div>
        <ol>
            <li>What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?
                <ul>
                    <li>We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential for every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is,
                        has an even stronger evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers should be able to answer.</li>
                    <li>Answer is Raichu</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?
                <ul>
                    <li> Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off with, but progressive upgrades are needed if you're looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you've
                        made your way through any Pokemon game, you've reached the point where you're presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no button mashing at all is required.</li>
                    <li>Answer is Master Ball</li>
                </ul>

                    Pokémon battles appear in most forms of Pokémon media, being the central gameplay aspect of the core series games, as well as being a constant focus of the anime.

                <p>Pokémon Go's Types are exactly the same as those in the main Pokémon games, but the effect of those type matchups is slightly different: in brief, things like effective or resisted attacks have slightly different multipliers to the main
                    Pokémon games - although a December 2018 update brought them slightly closer in line.
